DISCLAIMER
----------
This project exists so that I may acquaint myself with the Java programming language. The project serves as a motivator for exploring the features of the language, how to structure a Java project and how to write tests. At the same time it serves as an opportunity to get more familiar with the HTTP protocol.

Since I don't really know any Java, the quality of the code is likely to suffer accordingly. **Please don't use it in any way**. Hopefully it'll gradually improve as I improve. Or I might abandon the project, in which case it will not. The rest of this document is intended as a way for myself to keep track of what I want to implement.

Current goals
-----

- Simple web server that can be configured (through command-line options) to listen on a specific port and serve files from a configured directory.
- Unit tests
- Integration tests
